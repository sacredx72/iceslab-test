// - subscription_request_history is the high-churn offender (one row per /sub
//   poll; clients refresh every few minutes). The SRH inspector (K1-b) only
//   looks back 90d, so anything older is dead weight.
// - node_user_usage_history powers "top users today" (today only); 180d is
//   generous audit headroom.
// - node_usage_history feeds the dashboard's year-over-year traffic deltas
//   (startOfLastYear can reach ~24 months back at year-end), so it keeps a
//   wide 800-day window. Its cardinality is low (one row per node-hour), so
//   that's cheap to retain.
