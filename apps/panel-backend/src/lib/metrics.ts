/**
 * Prometheus metrics registry (slice 33).
 *
 * One process-global Registry. Default metrics (process CPU, memory, GC,
 * event-loop lag) + a small set of business-flavoured counters/gauges.
 *
 * Why a small set, not "everything":
 *   - Each label combination costs memory in the registry indefinitely.
 *     High-cardinality labels (user ids, node ids) explode quickly and
 *     turn the metrics endpoint into a slowloris vector.
 *   - We only add a metric when there's a concrete operator question it
 *     answers — alerting on it, or putting it on the dashboard.
 *
 * Mount path: `/metrics`. Gated behind `requireAuth` in app.ts (both JWT
 * admin sessions and `icp_*` API tokens work), so a Prometheus scrape
 * job needs an API token in its bearer header. No env knob — disabling
 * the endpoint is "don't scrape it"; default-metrics collection costs a
 * few microseconds per request so leaving it on always is fine.
