// CoreAdapter is the central abstraction of Iceslab: every proxy core wraps
// behind this interface, which lets the dispatcher treat them uniformly.
//
// Implementations live in `internal/core/<protocol>/` and are registered
// from main at startup based on which protocols the node is configured for.
//
// Contract notes:
//   - All methods are expected to be goroutine-safe.
//   - `AddUser` and `RemoveUser` MUST be idempotent — the panel may retry
//     a job after a partial failure, so re-applying the same operation is
//     a no-op.
//   - `Start` blocks only long enough to launch the underlying binary; it
//     does NOT wait for the binary to be ready to accept traffic. Use
//     `GetStats` polling or a healthcheck for readiness.
type CoreAdapter interface {
	// Name returns the protocol identifier (matches dto.ProtocolName).
	Name() string

	// Start launches the underlying core (subprocess, in-process server, ...).
	// Returning nil means the launch was initiated; readiness is asynchronous.
	Start(ctx context.Context) error

	// Stop gracefully terminates the core. Implementations should respect a
	// shutdown deadline (~5s) and force-kill on timeout.
	Stop(ctx context.Context) error

	// AddUser registers a user with the core. Idempotent.
	AddUser(user User) error

	// RemoveUser unregisters a user by id. Idempotent.
	RemoveUser(userID string) error

	// GetStats returns the latest traffic counters known to the core.
	GetStats() (*Stats, error)

	// Healthy reports whether the adapter is in a state where it can serve
	// traffic. Implementations should return true after Start() has fully
	// initialised local resources (callback servers, subprocesses, etc) and
	// false before Start() / after Stop() / when a subprocess has crashed.
	//
	// Used by the panel's healthcheck fan-out and the node-agent /healthz
	// endpoint to derive overall node status.
	Healthy() bool

	// ApplyInbound takes the protocol-specific config as raw JSON (the same
	// shape the panel pushes via /applyInbounds — see dto.InboundDto.Config).
	// Implementations parse what they need, regenerate their config file, and
	// reload/restart the underlying server.
	//
	// Contract:
	//   - Idempotent: re-applying the same config is a no-op (no restart).
	//   - Non-blocking on success: launches reload/restart asynchronously,
	//     returns once the new config is on disk.
	//   - Returns an error if the config JSON is malformed for this protocol
	//     or the regenerate/reload step fails.
	//   - When called with a config that doesn't match the adapter's protocol
	//     (e.g. xray cfg pushed to hysteria adapter), implementations should
	//     return nil — the dispatcher routes by protocol name, but defensive
	//     no-op is the safer contract.
	//
	// Slice 24b — replaces the env-var-only inbound config workflow that
	// admins had to hand-edit on every change. Panel auto-pushes via
	// /applyInbounds, dispatcher fans out to the matching adapter.
	ApplyInbound(cfg json.RawMessage) error
