## v0.1.4

Reliability hardening after a deep code audit: the bug-fix campaign, a deploy/
update fix so operators stop getting stuck on stale code, and a round of UI polish.

### Fixed

- **node-agent no longer stalls during a core restart.** Adapter mutexes were
  held across the multi-second subprocess restart (xray / shadowsocks / mtproto /
  mieru / naive), blocking `/healthz` and the panel's push workers, plus a data
  race on the Hysteria auth-callback. Locks are split so restarts run lock-free.
- **deploy/update no longer silently rebuilds stale code.** `deploy*.sh` ran
  `git pull --ff-only`, a no-op on the tag-pinned detached HEAD the installer
  leaves behind, so re-deploys quietly rebuilt the old version. They now sync to
  `ICESLAB_REF` (branch or tag), fetch all refs, and fail loudly on an ambiguous
  detached HEAD. The installer is a full clone so updates stay reachable.
- **deploy applies new migrations.** Migrations ran against the previous image
  before the rebuild, so a deploy that added a migration silently skipped it.
  Reordered to build, then migrate, then start.
- **multi-profile deploy to a fresh node.** Deploying several profiles to a new
  node assigned port 443 to every one, so all but the first failed with
  PORT_IN_USE. Each profile now gets a distinct port.
- **"Top users today" dashboard card** was always empty (the table it reads was
  never written); the stats poll now records per-user daily usage.
- Subscription endpoint name de-dup, inline port-edit collision check, bounded
  AmneziaWG IP allocation, and other audit fixes.

### Changed

- **Protocol dropdown** lists Xray first with a disabled "sing-box (soon)" teaser
  everywhere a protocol is chosen.
- **UI polish.** The Users status chips are now the single filter (dropped a
  duplicate control); node cards show the node address; filter chips are
  keyboard-operable.
- **Build resilience.** `prisma generate` retries on a flaky network during the
  Docker build, and the Prisma update-check call is disabled.

## v0.1.3

Subscription self-service for end users, plus a dashboard CPU-reporting fix
and an ops-script papercut.

### Added

- **Human-readable subscription page.** Opening `/sub/<token>` in a browser
  used to dump raw base64 ([#1](https://github.com/icecompany-tech/iceslab/issues/1)).
  It now serves a self-contained landing page: status (traffic / expiry /
  protocols), a copy-able subscription link, deep-link import buttons
  (Hiddify / Streisand / v2rayNG / Clash), and per-format download buttons
  including the AmneziaWG `.conf`. RU/EN by Accept-Language. VPN clients are
  unaffected (an explicit `?format=` always wins).
- **QR codes on the subscription page.** One QR for the subscription URL
  (scan to import in proxy clients) and, when an AmneziaWG endpoint exists, a
  QR of the wg-quick config text (scan straight into AmneziaVPN). Generated
  server-side as inline SVG via `qrcode-svg` (zero external requests).

### Fixed

- **Dashboard CPU headline.** The host CPU card showed a 200ms instantaneous
  sample taken while the backend builds the overview, so a 1-vCPU host saw
  its own work as an 80%+ spike. The headline now uses the 1-minute
  load-average percentage (sustained busy-ness); the sample stays as
  secondary detail.
- **Ops scripts run from anywhere.** `deploy.sh` / `restore.sh` / etc. errored
  when run from `scripts/` instead of the project root. They now auto-resolve
  the root, so `cd scripts && ./deploy.sh` works too.

### Performance

- **Dashboard overview cache TTL 8s → 30s.** At 8s the cache expired before
  almost every poll, so the ~20-query recompute ran every ~10s and pegged
  small hosts. Now throttled to at most twice a minute regardless of tab count.

## v0.1.2

Stabilization release: security hardening across the node-agent and installers,
a batch of panel performance fixes, and completion of the per-protocol port
wiring so port changes from the UI take effect on every core.

### Security

- **node-agent: config-injection guards.** AmneziaWG renders peer keys / AllowedIPs
  into the awg-quick INI and Hysteria renders obfs password / masquerade URL into
  YAML. Both now whitelist input (base64 WG keys, CIDR, no YAML metacharacters) so
  a hostile or buggy panel push can't break out of the config and inject
  `PostUp=` / top-level directives that run as root.
- **node-agent: constant-time panel-cert fingerprint compare**, mtproto Secret
  hex validation, Shadowsocks config now written via the atomic fsync helper
  (was a non-durable WriteFile+rename).
- **panel-auth: per-(IP, username) login lockout.** Username-only lockout let any
  bot lock out the real admin from a different IP; confirmed live during a
  distributed brute-force. Lockout state is now keyed on the source IP too.
- **panel-auth:** `cookie.secure` driven by `NODE_ENV`, admin usernames redacted
  in Telegram login alerts.
- **panel-backend: per-route auth.** Plugin-level `addHook` auth replaced with
  per-route `onRequest` across 9 route plugins so a future public route can't
  silently inherit no-auth (Fastify v5 quirk).
- **installer: supply-chain + token-leak hardening.** `--bootstrap-file` keeps
  the bootstrap token out of `/proc/cmdline`; optional `ICESLAB_REF_SHA` pins the
  expected commit so a re-pointed tag aborts the install. `fail2ban` jails for
  auth brute-force + probe scanners in domain mode.

### Fixed

- **installer pinned to v0.1.0.** Default `ICESLAB_REF` / `ICESLAB_NODE_REF` were
  still `v0.1.0`, so fresh installs pulled stale code with bugs already fixed in
  later releases. Now pinned to `v0.1.2`. ([#1](https://github.com/icecompany-tech/iceslab/issues/1))
- **per-protocol port wiring.** `ApplyInbound` now receives the panel binding
  port and every adapter (hysteria, amneziawg, xray, naive, shadowsocks, mtproto,
  mieru) rebinds to it. Previously the port was install-time only and UI port
  changes were silently dropped.
- **node-agent default port 8443 → 1337.** 8443 is the first port every scanner
  probes after 443; 1337 stays out of standard scanner profiles and frees 8443
  for a normal user-protocol binding. Existing nodes keep their pinned port.
- **quick-deploy picks the first free port** from `[443, 8443, 2053, 2083, 2087,
  2096]` instead of hardcoding 443 (which 409'd on any second binding). The UI
  flags a collision with the node-agent's own mTLS port.
- **node-agent fanout is best-effort.** A dormant/not-yet-Healthy adapter failing
  during addUser/removeUser no longer 500s the whole request (was breaking
  first-time backfill on fresh nodes).
- **heartbeat trusts system CAs + panel CA** so an LE-fronted public panel stops
  logging `certificate signed by unknown authority` on every heartbeat.
- **cron clears stale `lastStatusMessage`** when a node recovers from `degraded`
  (the old guard never re-wrote when the new message was empty).
- **MTProto tg:// URI** no longer carries a `#fragment` that strict Telegram
  parsers rejected.

### Performance

- **AWG IP allocation in one SQL round-trip** (was 3 queries + a 254-candidate
  JS scan per user).
- **inbounds-sync batches addUser** in bounded-parallel chunks instead of N
  serial mTLS round-trips.
- **UsersPage server-side pagination** + debounced search (was fetching up to 500
  users and paging in JS, silently truncating larger installs).
- **AppLayout reads sidebar counts from the dashboard cache** — one request
  instead of four full-list queries on every page transition.
- **removeUser cron enqueues deduped by jobId** (a stable orphan was re-enqueued
  ~144×/day).
- **dropped a redundant 10s dashboard poll** inside the node edit modal.

### Docs

- README: "Running multiple protocols on one node" section and an installer
  env-var table (`ICESLAB_REF`, `SKIP_SWAP`, `NODE_PORT`, `FRONTEND_PORT`).
  Russian README kept in parity.

## v0.1.1

First post-publication stabilization pass: docker-compose healthcheck path fix
(the first-install blocker), pnpm-install OOM mitigation on 2 GB VPS, dashboard
heap-percentage fix, login-lockout default relaxation, Subscription sidebar
section, and assorted i18n cleanup.

## v0.1.0

Initial public release: multi-core proxy operator panel (Hysteria 2 / Xray
REALITY / AmneziaWG / NaiveProxy / Shadowsocks 2022 / MTProto / Mieru) with
TypeScript Fastify backend, React Mantine SPA, and a Go node-agent over mTLS.
