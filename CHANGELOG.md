# Changelog

All notable changes to Iceslab are documented here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versions are git tags.

## v0.1.6

The largest release since the alpha opened: a censorship-survival toolkit for
hostile networks (routing presets, multi-hop cascades, REALITY self-steal), live
user management with no restarts, admin two-factor auth, operator analytics and a
Telegram bot, far broader client-app coverage, and a deep performance and
reliability audit across both the panel and the node-agent.

### Security

- **Admin two-factor auth (TOTP).** Optional RFC6238 TOTP on the admin login,
  with a guided enrollment (enable requires a confirmed code, so you cannot lock
  yourself out) and a disable flow. Recovery is a single SQL update if a device
  is lost. Additive: existing logins are untouched until an admin opts in.

### Added

- **Routing presets with split-DNS.** A subscription can carry a `ru-split`
  preset (ads and local destinations resolve and egress direct, everything else
  is tunneled), rendered correctly into the Xray-JSON, Clash and sing-box
  formats with a matching split-DNS block so lookups do not leak. Selectable per
  subscription, per squad (override), or via a `?routing=` query, plus a raw
  custom-rules editor for hand-written Xray routing rules.
- **Multi-hop cascades (experimental).** Chain nodes entry -> transit -> exit:
  the client connects to an entry node and traffic is forwarded hop to hop to an
  exit that egresses direct. Full operator UI (hop builder, reorder, validation)
  plus node-agent forwarding for the Xray vless cell. Built for networks where a
  single foreign hop is blocked; field validation is in progress.
- **REALITY self-steal (experimental).** A REALITY mode where the node runs its
  own local TLS fallback and presents its own domain, so the SNI and the server
  IP stay consistent (the mismatch that gets a borrowed-SNI REALITY connection
  mangled on aggressive DPI). Selectable per profile.
- **Live user add and remove with no restart.** Adding or removing an Xray or
  Shadowsocks user now goes through the core's runtime management API, so live
  connections are never dropped. It falls back to the previous config-restart
  path only when the runtime call cannot be made, so it can only improve on the
  old behaviour.
- **Operator analytics.** Dashboard bandwidth now shows deltas against the prior
  period on every window, plus a new Insights page: a subscription-request
  breakdown by client app and a HWID device-count distribution, both computed
  from already-stored data with no new tracking.
- **Operator Telegram bot.** A read-only bot answering `/status` and
  `/user <name>` to the operator chat, plus a daily digest of users near expiry
  or near their traffic cap.
- **Signed outbound webhooks.** User, profile and node events are forwarded to
  configured URLs with an HMAC-SHA256 signature over the payload.
- **Broader client-app coverage.** New subscription formats: XKeen (Xray confdir
  for Keenetic routers), Outline / SIP008, Surge, Quantumult X and Loon.
- **Multi-core node UX.** Add a second protocol to an existing node from the node
  view, with an auto-picked free port and a human-readable message when a port is
  already taken. Plus a masquerade REALITY recipe and a test-connect that probes
  the REALITY dest for resolvability and TLS 1.3.
- **Per-squad defaults.** A squad can carry a routing-preset override and a
  default HWID device limit.

### Changed

- **Panel performance pass.** Response schemas for fast JSON serialization on the
  hot dashboard and user-list endpoints, in-process caches for subscription
  settings, squad bindings and blacklist lookups (all write-busted), bulk
  single-statement traffic upserts and AmneziaWG peer pre-allocation, cursor
  pagination on backfill, and lazy-loaded frontend routes (initial bundle cut by
  about a third).
- **Node-agent reliability.** Adapter locks are split so a multi-second core
  restart no longer blocks health checks or the panel's push workers, a bounded
  restart-on-crash supervisor backs every spawned core, subprocesses are
  group-killed so no orphans leak, and stats and health probes run concurrently
  with cached AmneziaWG and UFW reads plus zero-user short-circuits.

### Fixed

- **AmneziaWG runaway traffic.** AWG reported kernel-cumulative counters where the
  panel expected per-poll deltas, so a peer's lifetime total was re-billed on
  every poll and drained quotas. The agent now emits true deltas (baseline on
  first sight, so an agent restart never re-bills the backlog).
- **Editing a limited or expired user no longer fails.** Saving such a user
  returned 400 on every attempt; it now reactivates correctly, and a 0 GB
  traffic limit is read as unlimited.
- **Per-user stats no longer error on multi-inbound users.** A user present on
  more than one inbound of a node tripped a Postgres conflict (21000); per-user
  rows are aggregated before the bulk upsert.
- **Node firewall self-heals on boot.** UFW was only opened for an inbound's port
  inside the applyInbounds push handler, so a node that restarted (or whose rule
  was lost to a reimage, or to a transient `ufw allow` that has no retry) could
  run its core with the port closed until the next push. The agent now re-ensures
  UFW for every persisted inbound on startup. Caught live: xray reachable from
  abroad but the binding port was firewalled.
- **Smaller audit fixes.** IPv6-aware subscription host parsing, a human-readable
  port-conflict 409 naming the node and profile, an online-aware node status dot,
  a flag-emoji guard for non-ISO country codes, a bounded Hysteria auth-callback
  body, and a settings form that re-seeds from the server after save.

## v0.1.5

Full Xray protocol matrix: VLESS, VMess and Trojan over any transport and any
security mode, behind a guided picker. Plus an update-available indicator and a
round of VPS hardening.

### Security

- **nginx ships hardening headers.** `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`,
  `Referrer-Policy` and `server_tokens off` on every response. CSP is left to the
  operator so a wrong policy can't silently break the SPA.

### Added

- **Full Xray protocol matrix.** A profile can now run VLESS, VMess or Trojan over
  any of the six transports (raw, WebSocket, gRPC, xHTTP, HTTPUpgrade, mKCP) and
  any security mode: REALITY, plain `none` (for a CDN that terminates TLS itself),
  or node-terminated TLS with your own certificate. A guided three-step picker
  (protocol, then transport, then security) reveals only the fields each
  combination needs, and every combination is emitted correctly into the
  raw/base64, Clash, sing-box and Xray-JSON subscription formats.
- **Update-available indicator.** The sidebar shows an accent dot linking to the
  release when a newer version ships. The panel checks the latest GitHub release
  (cached 6h, best-effort: it never blocks a request or breaks if GitHub is
  unreachable, and needs no token on the public repo).

### Changed

- **Subscription formatters are security-aware.** Clash, sing-box and Xray-JSON
  hardcoded REALITY for every Xray endpoint, so a `none` or `tls` profile would
  have produced a broken client config. They now render the correct security
  block per endpoint and carry all three subprotocols.
- **VPS resource and secret safety.** Redis is capped (`--maxmemory` with
  `noeviction`, so a runaway can't OOM a small host and queued jobs are never
  silently dropped), and `deploy.sh` snapshots `.env.production` (the only on-host
  copy of the JWT secret, DB password and node mTLS CA) to a timestamped backup
  ring before each deploy.

## v0.1.4

Reliability hardening after a deep code audit: the bug-fix campaign, a deploy/
update fix so operators stop getting stuck on stale code, and a round of UI polish.

### Fixed

- **node-agent no longer stalls during a core restart.** Adapter mutexes were
  held across the multi-second subprocess restart (xray / shadowsocks / mtproto /
  mieru / naive), blocking `/healthz` and the panel's push workers, plus a data
  race on the Hysteria auth-callback. Locks are split so restarts run lock-free.
- **deploy/update no longer silently rebuilds stale code.** `deploy*.sh` ran
  `git pull --ff-only`, a no-op on the tag-pinned detached HEAD the installer
  leaves behind, so re-deploys quietly rebuilt the old version. They now sync to
  `ICESLAB_REF` (branch or tag), fetch all refs, and fail loudly on an ambiguous
  detached HEAD. The installer is a full clone so updates stay reachable.
- **deploy applies new migrations.** Migrations ran against the previous image
  before the rebuild, so a deploy that added a migration silently skipped it.
  Reordered to build, then migrate, then start.
- **multi-profile deploy to a fresh node.** Deploying several profiles to a new
  node assigned port 443 to every one, so all but the first failed with
  PORT_IN_USE. Each profile now gets a distinct port.
- **"Top users today" dashboard card** was always empty (the table it reads was
  never written); the stats poll now records per-user daily usage.
- Subscription endpoint name de-dup, inline port-edit collision check, bounded
  AmneziaWG IP allocation, and other audit fixes.

### Changed

- **Protocol dropdown** lists Xray first with a disabled "sing-box (soon)" teaser
  everywhere a protocol is chosen.
- **UI polish.** The Users status chips are now the single filter (dropped a
  duplicate control); node cards show the node address; filter chips are
  keyboard-operable.
- **Build resilience.** `prisma generate` retries on a flaky network during the
  Docker build, and the Prisma update-check call is disabled.

## v0.1.3

Subscription self-service for end users, plus a dashboard CPU-reporting fix
and an ops-script papercut.

### Added

- **Human-readable subscription page.** Opening `/sub/<token>` in a browser
  used to dump raw base64 ([#1](https://github.com/icecompany-tech/iceslab/issues/1)).
  It now serves a self-contained landing page: status (traffic / expiry /
  protocols), a copy-able subscription link, deep-link import buttons
  (Hiddify / Streisand / v2rayNG / Clash), and per-format download buttons
  including the AmneziaWG `.conf`. RU/EN by Accept-Language. VPN clients are
  unaffected (an explicit `?format=` always wins).
- **QR codes on the subscription page.** One QR for the subscription URL
  (scan to import in proxy clients) and, when an AmneziaWG endpoint exists, a
  QR of the wg-quick config text (scan straight into AmneziaVPN). Generated
  server-side as inline SVG via `qrcode-svg` (zero external requests).

### Fixed

- **Dashboard CPU headline.** The host CPU card showed a 200ms instantaneous
  sample taken while the backend builds the overview, so a 1-vCPU host saw
  its own work as an 80%+ spike. The headline now uses the 1-minute
  load-average percentage (sustained busy-ness); the sample stays as
  secondary detail.
- **Ops scripts run from anywhere.** `deploy.sh` / `restore.sh` / etc. errored
  when run from `scripts/` instead of the project root. They now auto-resolve
  the root, so `cd scripts && ./deploy.sh` works too.

### Performance

- **Dashboard overview cache TTL 8s → 30s.** At 8s the cache expired before
  almost every poll, so the ~20-query recompute ran every ~10s and pegged
  small hosts. Now throttled to at most twice a minute regardless of tab count.

## v0.1.2

Stabilization release: security hardening across the node-agent and installers,
a batch of panel performance fixes, and completion of the per-protocol port
wiring so port changes from the UI take effect on every core.

### Security

- **node-agent: config-injection guards.** AmneziaWG renders peer keys / AllowedIPs
  into the awg-quick INI and Hysteria renders obfs password / masquerade URL into
  YAML. Both now whitelist input (base64 WG keys, CIDR, no YAML metacharacters) so
  a hostile or buggy panel push can't break out of the config and inject
  `PostUp=` / top-level directives that run as root.
- **node-agent: constant-time panel-cert fingerprint compare**, mtproto Secret
  hex validation, Shadowsocks config now written via the atomic fsync helper
  (was a non-durable WriteFile+rename).
- **panel-auth: per-(IP, username) login lockout.** Username-only lockout let any
  bot lock out the real admin from a different IP; confirmed live during a
  distributed brute-force. Lockout state is now keyed on the source IP too.
- **panel-auth:** `cookie.secure` driven by `NODE_ENV`, admin usernames redacted
  in Telegram login alerts.
- **panel-backend: per-route auth.** Plugin-level `addHook` auth replaced with
  per-route `onRequest` across 9 route plugins so a future public route can't
  silently inherit no-auth (Fastify v5 quirk).
- **installer: supply-chain + token-leak hardening.** `--bootstrap-file` keeps
  the bootstrap token out of `/proc/cmdline`; optional `ICESLAB_REF_SHA` pins the
  expected commit so a re-pointed tag aborts the install. `fail2ban` jails for
  auth brute-force + probe scanners in domain mode.

### Fixed

- **installer pinned to v0.1.0.** Default `ICESLAB_REF` / `ICESLAB_NODE_REF` were
  still `v0.1.0`, so fresh installs pulled stale code with bugs already fixed in
  later releases. Now pinned to `v0.1.2`. ([#1](https://github.com/icecompany-tech/iceslab/issues/1))
- **per-protocol port wiring.** `ApplyInbound` now receives the panel binding
  port and every adapter (hysteria, amneziawg, xray, naive, shadowsocks, mtproto,
  mieru) rebinds to it. Previously the port was install-time only and UI port
  changes were silently dropped.
- **node-agent default port 8443 → 1337.** 8443 is the first port every scanner
  probes after 443; 1337 stays out of standard scanner profiles and frees 8443
  for a normal user-protocol binding. Existing nodes keep their pinned port.
- **quick-deploy picks the first free port** from `[443, 8443, 2053, 2083, 2087,
  2096]` instead of hardcoding 443 (which 409'd on any second binding). The UI
  flags a collision with the node-agent's own mTLS port.
- **node-agent fanout is best-effort.** A dormant/not-yet-Healthy adapter failing
  during addUser/removeUser no longer 500s the whole request (was breaking
  first-time backfill on fresh nodes).
- **heartbeat trusts system CAs + panel CA** so an LE-fronted public panel stops
  logging `certificate signed by unknown authority` on every heartbeat.
- **cron clears stale `lastStatusMessage`** when a node recovers from `degraded`
  (the old guard never re-wrote when the new message was empty).
- **MTProto tg:// URI** no longer carries a `#fragment` that strict Telegram
  parsers rejected.

### Performance

- **AWG IP allocation in one SQL round-trip** (was 3 queries + a 254-candidate
  JS scan per user).
- **inbounds-sync batches addUser** in bounded-parallel chunks instead of N
  serial mTLS round-trips.
- **UsersPage server-side pagination** + debounced search (was fetching up to 500
  users and paging in JS, silently truncating larger installs).
- **AppLayout reads sidebar counts from the dashboard cache** - one request
  instead of four full-list queries on every page transition.
- **removeUser cron enqueues deduped by jobId** (a stable orphan was re-enqueued
  ~144×/day).
- **dropped a redundant 10s dashboard poll** inside the node edit modal.

### Docs

- README: "Running multiple protocols on one node" section and an installer
  env-var table (`ICESLAB_REF`, `SKIP_SWAP`, `NODE_PORT`, `FRONTEND_PORT`).
  Russian README kept in parity.

## v0.1.1

First post-publication stabilization pass: docker-compose healthcheck path fix
(the first-install blocker), pnpm-install OOM mitigation on 2 GB VPS, dashboard
heap-percentage fix, login-lockout default relaxation, Subscription sidebar
section, and assorted i18n cleanup.

## v0.1.0

Initial public release: multi-core proxy operator panel (Hysteria 2 / Xray
REALITY / AmneziaWG / NaiveProxy / Shadowsocks 2022 / MTProto / Mieru) with
TypeScript Fastify backend, React Mantine SPA, and a Go node-agent over mTLS.
